# Disaster Tweets Classification

Natural disasters often result in a large
amount of damage and loss of life. In recent
years, social media platforms such as Twitter
have become important channels for people
to share information about disasters and their
effects. This has led to the development of
machine learning algorithms for analyzing
Twitter data to better understand and respond
to disasters.

## Neural Network Models used for comparative analysis

- CNN (Convolution Neural Network)
- RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
- BiGRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit)
- BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory)
